Data: to give
Capta: to take

What is taken from all possible

Data are prior to interpretation, to convert them to facts and information

## Data classifications
* nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio
* structured, semi-structured, unstructured
* primary, secondary, tertiary
* indexical, attribute data, metadata


## Misc
Beagrie et al 2010

Sharing -> interdisciplinary science
As much value as possible to be extracted

Requirements of a data sharing infrastructure

## Disincentives to sharing data
* lack of rewards
* effort to prepare and archive
* lack of expertise
* concern over value extracted before others
* concern over misinterpretation
* intellectual property issues
* wasted effort to archive if it likely wouldn't be used

## Funding open data
Challenges to fund open data, eg. for governments, since the data itself can't be the source of income. Complications:
1. Third party contracts to manage and host data = likely charging the data users to pay for their contributions
2. Third party resellers lobbying the gov to restrict data, since they normally sell it
3. Data sales normally fund gov services
4. New systems required to make data open and suitable for public (eg. annonymized and/or aggregated). Non-trivial and challenging to justify spending required.
