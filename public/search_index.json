Routledge, London; New York Keywords: [[urban political ecology]], [[environmental justice]] 2.0.1 Chapter 1: Urban political ecology - politicizing the production of urban natures Cities are dense networks of interwoven socio-spatial processes that are simultaneously local and global, human and physical, cultural and organic. All processes that support and maintain urban life are infinitely connected physical and social proceses. Literature historical lacked an integration of the urban environment with its intimate relationship with capitalist urbanization and socioenvironmental injustice. Also, we have ignored the urbanization process as the driving force behind environmental issues and socio-environmental issues. Capitalism forceses the externalization of nature - but the accumulation of capital depends on nature. The conceptualization as ecosystems as inherently intertwined with social processes and thus humans started early - Friedrich Engels in 1845 noted that the depressing ecological conditions of England’s cities were related to the class character of industrial urbanization. Transformation of nature and the related social relations are inextricably linked to urbanization. The production of the city through socio-environmental changes results in continuous production of new urban natures - all of these processes occur in the realms of power where different social actors strive to create their own environments. David Harvey - cities cannot be unnatural because humans are not external to ecosystem function - thus, produced environments are specific historical results of socio-environmental processes. In capitalist cities, “nature” takes the primarily social form of commidities - this commodity relation hides the socio-ecological processes of domination/subordiation and exploitation/repression that underpin the capitalist urbanization process. The commodification of nature, underpinning market-based society, obscures social relations of power and allows a disconnection of the flows of nature from its foundation. Need to focus on natural artefacts of cities and on the social processes that created the injustice and produced such artefacts. Metabolism = labour. Materialist approach = nature is part of the metabolism of social life - social relations operate through metabolizing the natural environment, and transform society and nature. Under capitalist social relations, production of value operates through social relations and nature/labour produce commodities with the goal of making the exchange value - thus, circulation of capital as value is the metabolic transformations of socio-natures. For example, the production of dams or the making of an urban park. Processes of uneven deterioration that accompany socioeconomics in cities also contribute to changes in the ecological form. And enhancing environmental qualities in certain areas often leads to a deterioration of social and physical conditions elsewhere. Manifesto 10 points are really good. 2.0.2 Chapter 2: Metabolic urbanization - the making of cyborg cities Materialism - asserts that both origin and development of what exists is dependent on nature and matter. Production = metabolic process that occurs through the fusion of physical properties and the creative capacities of humans with those of non-humans. Labouring = purposeful metabolic process intended to produce and reproduce (human) life. Humans are different than others is their organic capacity to wish differentially. Metabolic process is mobilized through human participation in nature/transformation of natural material into organs of human will. Thus, the act of labouring constitutes a socio-ecological process. Metabolism refers to the transformation (of nature/humans/things). Metabolic circulation combines physical dynamics with social conditions aka mode of production. Products used by labour in production enter as specific assemblages/collectives/networks, which then mobilize social processes and human/non-human actants to produce new assemblages = metabolism. Collectives are part social-part natural and embody and express nature and society - they take on cultural, social, and physical forms and enter social and ecological processes in new and transformeed ways - a city can be thought of as a collective which is why metabolism and circulation and good metaphors to use when discussing them. Metabolism is the central construct of Marx’s labour - humans take materials of nature and transform them using their own bodies to something that is adapted to his needs. Social relations operate through metabolizing the natural environment, and transform both society and nature. Labour is the organic activity through which metabloism is mobilized. Adam Smith &amp; Karl Marx conceived of a capitalist economy as a metabolic system of circulating money/commidities, carried by and structured through social interactions and relations. Cities were conceptualized as circulation - network of pipes and conduits, with the idea being that the brisker the flow, the greater the wealth and health. Cities were changed to be a space for movemement of people, commidities, and information - which altered choreography of the city. Metabolic circulation is the socially mediated process of environmental transformation and trans-configuration, through which all manner of “agents” are mobilized/attached/collectivized/networked. The city is a metabolic circulatory process that materializes as an implosion of socio-netural relations. Cities can be described as a process of geographically arranged socio-environmental metabolisms. The urbanization process forces nature to enter the sphere of money and cultural capital/associated power relations and redraws socio-natural power relations. Cities can be conceptualized as hybrids/cyborgs - combining the powers of nature with those of class, gender, and ethnic relations. 2.0.3 Chapter 3: Metropolitics and metabolics - rolling out environmentalism in Toronto Neoliberism in 1990s Toronto had unexpected outcome of strengthening the urban ecological agenda. Domination of nature and domination of humankind are connected processes that come together in the urban. Urban metabolism as a means of quantifying the overall fluxes of energy, water, material, and wastes in and out of an urban region. Amalgamation of Toronto has had net positive effects on urban environmental discourse due to the environmental activism that resulted. 2.0.4 Chapter 4: Urban nature and the ecological imaginary Nature here includes a menagerie of concrete forms, ranging from human body to parks/gardens/ecosystems and an ideological/metaphorical schema for the interpretation of reality. The production of nature is a process of social and bio-physical change where new kinds of spaces are created and destroyed. The modern city’s form and function is understood using a series of metaphors called the “ecological imaginary”. Urban development is intertwined with cultural views of cities and nature. Nineteenth-century beautification movements sought to reintroduce nature to cities and new organic spaces appeared to re-establish contact between nature and urban society. In the twentieth century, people changed their relationship to the urban landscape, driven to a significant degree by car ownership. Focus on beautification and importance of nature shifted as the culture became pmore polarized and there was a more piecemeal emphasis on the decorative contributions of nature. 2.0.5 Chapter 5: Nature’s carnival - the ecology of pleasure at Coney Island Coney Island displays nature as spectacle - intertwines multiple different types of nature into a new package that is wildly popular. Theory of nature/wilderness as interpreted by humans. The carnival provides nature in a way that is thrilling but not truly dangerous - like when environmentalistrs seek thrills in the Rockies 2.0.6 Chapter 6: The desire to metabolize nature - Edward Loveden Loveden, William Vanderstegen, and the disciplining of the river Thames The investment in fixed capital works (locks) began the process of making the river Thames a metabolized second nature. “Improving” the river through this metabolization was necessary for faster circulation of value. The Thames landscape represented the “real” needs generated by demands of living, the “imagined” wants generated by culture and the “symbolic” desires created by people’s feelings. So, the locks (solid capital) legitimized the existing social structure because they created the conditions for the reproduction of capital and acted as manifestations of contemporary social relations. Circulation was the key theory explaining the accumulation of wealth until the late 18th century. In the 1770s, the concern shifted from circulation to “surplus” and now the most important issue was the conservation of the river’s water. 2.0.7 Chapter 7: Turfgrass subjects - the political economy of urban monoculture Urban lawns represent a manifestation of how people living in systems that produce unevenly distributed costs/shifting risk ecologies feel distant from the ecological process. Lawns make up 25% of land cover in some states, and the majority of urban land cover. Lawns became ubiqutous relatively recently, following WWII. The lawn itself is a socio-technical system that is part of capitalized production, which produces urban/suburban suhects whose identity is connected to the purified lawn and disciplined by the material demands of the landscape they inherit. Pesticides used on lawns have serious human health and ecosystem impacts. The lawn acts as a community ideology - people often take care of their lawns for their neighbours and for the betterment of the community, they are more likely to know their neighbours and care about what happens in the community. Thus, chemical use becomes clustered. Yard management is done for social purposes - production of community. 2.0.8 Chapter 8: Justice of eating in the city - the political ecology of urban hunger Urban hunger is proliferating - 88% increase in requests for emergency food assistance in US cities from 1997-2002. In 2003 alne, requests increase by 17% on average. Pablo Neruda reminds us that there is nothing inevitable about the tearstained sheets that shroud hunger, just as there is nothing inevitable about the capitalist system that produces it. Urban hunger is both a socio-economic and socio-natural problem that requires analysis within the context of urban metabolism. Marx’s approach states that humans must satisfy their NEEDS (hunger) before they can live full lives. Hunger needs a nature outside of itself. Commodification of food under capitalism means that access to food is based on what happens with food production elsewhere + extreme inequality has mean that many people have increasingly less access to food. The worker is fearfully handicapped by hunger - he does not have power because he cannot afford to wait if he disagrees with the capitalist. Reagan administration created food deserts in urban communities. Capitalism is responsible for the physical reconfiguration of urban space which has produced urban hunger. It is the everyday approach that will make a difference for urban hunger. 2.0.9 Chapter 9: Metabolisms of obe-city - flows of fat through bodies, cities and sewers Harvey: “Cities are constituted out of the flows of energy, water, food, commoditie, money, people and all other necessities that sustain life”. 2.0.10 Chapter 10: The political ecology of water scarcity - the 1989-1991 Athenian drought Athens passed laws to name water as a “natural gift” and the access to potable water as the right of every citizen.

Environ Res Lett. https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac12f2 Keywords: Urban heat island, [[temperature mitigation]], [[canopy cover]] Relationship between tree canopy and cooling is most likely non-linear, with no benefits experienced until 25-50% cover. Clustering of vegetation is a determinant of how much cooling occurs at the site of examination and surrounding areas. Street trees have a “distributed canopy” that is overtop a hard surface – which makes cooling harder. Used impervious surface, building height, and skyview as built factors. Building shade and canopy cover attributed cooling effects. Impervious surface caused similar amounts of heating. Nighttime was crucial because impervious surfaces re-released heat. Soft canopy cover cooled best, hard canopy cover still cooled but was not found at high % and thus cooled less but was still important in the afternoon. Cooling effect changes in evening because trees provide more shade at the decreased angle of the sun. Impervious surface did not have much of an effect because the areas with highest amount of impervious surface also had tall buildings, which provided cooling through shading.

Promotion of green infrastructure often comes at a cost for socially and economically vulnerable, under the guise of “universal benefits”. Green gentrification causes displacement, weakening security, erases traditional ways of life, and creates environmental privilege for the upper class. Sustainability planning that doesnt explicitly include social justice creates injustice - sustainability that focuses on compact growth is often tied to real estate and economic goals. Creation of ecological enclaves through green infrastructure projects can jeopardize long-term municipal efforts to create a more just city.

Good definitions. Urban ecological and evolutionary processes are influenced by social patterns and processes. Little research integrates urban evolutionary biology with eco-evolutionary dynamics and both fields fail to consider how human social processes impact them. Intraspecific and interspecific interactions differ significantly between urban and nonurban habitats. Conceptual diagram for dynamics between social, ecological, and evolutionary patterns and processes. Presence of cities is present in human genes. Artifical selection and other evolutionary adaptations that occurred with humans help us understand evolution and reflect socioeconomic patterns.

This is a conceptual framework that IPBES will use moving forward in research that builds off the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Six main elements that link people and nature: nature, anthropogenic assets, nature’s benefits to people, institutions and governance systems and other indirect drivers, direct drivers, good quality of life. There are different approaches to each of the main elements as well as complex interactions linking them. The processes described occur at multiple scales and management levels. The links between nature and benefits to people are strongly scale-dependent and straddle many scales. Intrinsic values are those inherent to nature independent of human judgement (e.g. non-human species’ right to exist) and they have no relationship with possible benefits to humans or their quality of life. Instrumental values are closely associated with the notion of nature’s benefits as far as they allow people to achieve a good quality of life. Relational values are imbedded in desirable relationships. Good glossary of relevant terms at the end.

At this time, men were thought to hold the knowledge on how to conquer nature and also how to design cities. Cities were viewed as dirty and wild in the post-war modern era. City beautification – or feminization – gained currency when it was realized that it was necessary to create a successful industrial city. Women designers were prominent in designing green parks and fundamental to implementing playgrounds in the US.

Early research on urbanization in MTL focused on the regional decline - during the economic rise of Toronto and reconfiguration of transportation occurring between 1970-2000. Recently the suburbs have become key to the study of urbanization in MTL. Saint-Michel is a multi-ethnic neighbourhood dominated by Haitian and North African communities and recent migrants. There are linear configurations (city discards without reusing resources) and circular configurations (city reuses discarded materials and resources) within urban metabolism theory. Environmental and socio-spatial trajectories of St-Michel are intertwined and inseparable. Quarrying of limestone and clay was a decisive role in the construction of the MTL agglomeration, especially its center. Quarrying left its mark - with most public parks being built on former excavations, although most of these were small (1-10ha). Quarries in St-Michel were 192 and 94 ha - 42% of the surface of the district. They remained active longer than other quarries and provided grey limestone and cement for the construction of large-scale buildings in the modern city. Miron quarry was converted into MTL’s main dump and Francon quarry was turned into snow dump site - it is still in operation. The snow dump site impacts the neighbourhood through compromising safety and air quality - as well as isolating the district by reducing transport. Saint-Michel’s population boomed following WW2 - it was described as a new suburb, first attracting quarry workers who wanted to be close to their jobs and then immigrants. 75% of current building stock was constructed 1945-60s to meet the demand for housing - the result was poorly planned urbanization where housing was directly adjacent to industrial areas. The creation of an expressway dividing st-michel in half was experienced as a profound upheaval for residents. The result is an isolated, extremely dense population that has to travel further for services - a neighbourhood in the margins experiencing crisis since the 80s. There has been increase in poverty and unemployment - transformed from a working-class neighbourhood to a disadvantaged neighbourhood in the 80s. Average income is ~ $20,000 less than Montreal’s average and 10% of buildings are in disrepair. Extremely important neighbourhood for immigrants. Saint-Michael was annexed to city of MTL in 1968 to try and decrease fragmentation and lead to improved economic (and otherwise) unity. CMM/CUM administration brought together all the cities on hte island of Montreal with the hope of redistributing municipal service costs more equitably - this coincided with reorg of waste management. After annexation, Saint Michel received waste from the entire island of MTL, part of a political strategy to take waste “away from the center”, playing an integral role in development of MTL. Since annexation, it has been part of the “urban renewal project”. Administration bought quarry from Miron company and made the public decision to transform it into a metropolitan park 1994-2001 (called CESM). The CESM is becoming a showcase of environmental waste management through recycling sites and methane capture. The project means to attract people and bolster MTL’s reputation. However, there is a large discrepancy between resident needs/priorities and this project - causing further splintering/fragmentation between htis local space and neighbourhood identity. Saint Michel residents are concerned abut gentrification and lack of consultation. Most educational, recreational, and commercial investments were made in the part of the park that is furthest away from the majority of Saint-Michel residents.

Several decades are needed to fully realize ambitious plans to increase the extent of urban forest. Combining tree age classes is important for maintaining consistent canopy cover. Trees, gardens, and landscape design are used to indicate status and wealth – which is why universities are okay with dedicating time and money to canopy cover.

Using today’s socioeconomic statistics to evaluate urban trees ignores the lag time between tree planting and maturation. Current vegetation cover can be predicted by socioeconomic data from several decades prior. There are human and biophysical [[legacy effects]] to current tree cover in cities. Bioregional context determines starting conditions of urban forests and their development. Some trees have historical cultural significance in certain time periods and that has a legacy effect due to increased planting during that time period - e.g. widespread planting of Acer trees in Canada due to symbolism. The first urban tree movement in the US started in the 19th century with higher urbanized populations and associated health concerns - still leaves legacies to this day. Canada often used the US as inspiration for tree planting in their cities. Suburban areas expanded in mid-20th century in Canada. Building age often correlates with tree cover in a nonlinear way.

Legacies of urban form and sociodemographic change also shape UTC patterns. Time lag of tree maturity means that multi-decadal time scales are required to see shifts in UTC. Shifts from urban/agricultural -&gt; suburban have seen increases to UTC but relationship is not always present. It is critical to incorporate historical information. Urbanization/shrinkage/land-use change is not uniform and often has very complex relationships with the history of a place. Looked at specific mechanisms of UTC change. Visually interpreted aerial imagery to assess land cover change. UTC increased most in protected open areas (parks) and most change occurred from switching herbaceous land cover to treed land cover. Open protected areas were also more stable in tree presence. Different planning districts have different changes in UTC but none experienced a loss of UTC. Generally, UTC increases were derived from losses in herbaceous cover, with one planning district experiencing a decrease in building cover. The urban renewal period saw the city expanding into surrounding agricultural land. Urban decline led to disinvestment from municipal parks, leading to urban greening efforts by local NGOs. Also, several large tracts became private/state/federal parks. Former agricultural and rural lands transformed into suburban/industrial landscapes reduced herbaceous cover, increased building/impervious/UTC cover. Municipal parks experienced largest gain of UTC of any classification - also had the most stable UTC with 90% of trees present 40 years ago persisting to today. Divestment in park budgets results in unmaintained parks with unintentional forest emergence - causing increase in UTC. Specific planting initiatives also increased UTC in parks. Land cover transitions were linked across the city. UTC gains occurred across socioeconomic lines but the historical angle is extremely important - high-density neighbourhoods had less space for planting but experienced more UTC gains than neighbourhoods with more space but higher % of black people. Philadelphia did not experience major invasive pests during study time frame.

Landscape Ecol 32:15–30. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-016-0432-4 Keywords: [[ecology of cities]], [[heterogeneity]] Spatial hetereogeneity in social-ecological systems is a key concept for influences on ecosystem processes, sustainability, equity, urban design, etc. How researchers frame heterogeneity impacts how sustainability promotion is modelled. Show how the framework of spatial heterogeneity in ecology of cities (as opposed to ecology in cities) supports more effective measurement, improves management, and relates better to design. Heterogeneity results from various processes – ecological, built infrastructure, land use types, etc. Spatial heterogeneity is crucial to urban sustainability. Diagram comparing ecology in and of cities and appraches to spatial heterogeneity. Ecology in cities doesn’t take into account social attributes with the exception of occasional, coarse scale parameters. Ecology in cities often maps land use types as discrete pixels at low resolutions – this may not accurately capture spatial heterogeneity of urban systems, need to shift the paradigm. Ecology of cities describes spatial heterogeneity using hybrid compositional elements. Hybridity reflects patch structure from biophysical and social-economic sources. Use the patch mosaic model for modellign spatial heterogeneity using ecology of cities. Increasing spatial and conceptual resolution CAN go together but they are separate concepts. Ecology of cities provides a more holistic view of the city landscape for management. Urban design parallels the ecology of cities framework – recognizing that every patch has value.

Forest studies on biodiversity-ecosystem function have ignored landscape structure. Measured connectivity using frag-stats. Large managed forest fragments had highest C stocks. Species richness was highest in connected, unamanaged fragments and lowest in connected, managed fragments. Functional dispersion lowest in large, managed fragments. Functional diversity was a significant predictor of C stocks. Biodiversity conservation can lead to increased quantities of C stored at the landscape scale. Increasing connectivity may strengthen the synergy between biodiversity and C.

Landscape Ecol 32:2205–2218. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-017-0545-4 Keywords: [[historical]], agriculture, urban, [[land cover]], [[legacy effects]] Historical land use effects on ES can change over time. Three conditions where land-use legacies are especially important for understanding current ES supply: intrinsically slow ecological processes govern ES supply, time lags between land-use change and ecosystem responses delay the effects on ES supply, threshold relationships exist so that changes in ES may be difficult to reverse. Soil ES, environmental pollutants are example of slow ecological processes governing ES. Time lag effects can be especially pronounced for biodiversity-based services (e.g. exinction debts) and hydrologic services. Studies have not yet addressed thresholds and reversibility related to land-use legacies. Hydrologic ES, soil P levels, flood mitigation are examples of ES that experience historical thresholds and legacy lock-ins. Long-term consequences of new contaminants may provide unaticipated challenges for future ES supply (e.g. microplastics) "],["ziter_et_al_2019.html", "113 Ziter_et_al_2019", " 113 Ziter_et_al_2019 Ziter CD, Pedersen EJ, Kucharik CJ, Turner MG (2019) Scale-dependent interactions between tree canopy cover and impervious surfaces reduce daytime urban heat during summer.

Air temperature at the intraurban fine-scale is sparse. Air temperature decreased nonlinearly with increasing tree canopy cover and effects were larger at broader scales. Air temperature increased linearly with increasing impervious cover. Increasing [[canopy cover]] was more effective at reducing temperature than decreasing impervious cover. Effect was more pronounced during the day. Reducing impervious surfaces decreases temperatures at night – very important.

Ecological Applications 28:643–654. https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1689 Keywords: [[carbon storage]], ES, [[historical]], [[land cover]] Urban areas are temporally heterogeneous on a fine scale – often urban areas expand and take over previously agricultural land, making them ideal for studying land-use legacies. Land cover based proxies are poor tool for measuring ES – cities are too heterogeneous. Need to understand which ES indicators vary among and within land-cover classes. Historical land-use affects ecosystem functions for decades to millennia. ES related to soil may be particularly sensitive to temporal impacts. Measured soil characteristics on previously agricultural land to see legacy effect on C storage, water quality, and runoff. Soil C varied with time since development but relationship differed among land cover classes and with depth. Soil properties varied with time since development, indicating that land-use legacies can influence current urban ES. There were differences among land cover classes in the spatial scales at which variance in soil properties was most pronounced – most likely due to management.
