## Metadata
[[Whitlock_et_al_2011]] mentions the value of publishing data alongside a paper that uses it, as the methods will help speak to the data. I personally disagree since it is insufficient to use a document not properly structured to describe data, as a placeholder or alternative for metadata. 

There is much less complexity in designing consistent metadata structure for animal movement data than other forms of ecological data. The [[structure-of-movement-data]], at it's simplest, is a series of rows with locations (longitude, latitude), individual identifier and time. Additional information may indicate precision of the location, number of satellites, etc.

Avoid the trap of making another standard

## Format
Text based file format, non-proprietary [[Whitlock_et_al_2011]]. In the case of animal movement data, CSV or TSV. 

## Rights to data
[[Duke_et_al_2013]] access to data is a right
