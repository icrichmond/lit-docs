Cavin, L. and Jump, A.S., 2017. Highest drought sensitivity and lowest resistance to growth suppression are found in the range core of the tree Fagus sylvatica L. not the equatorial range edge. _Global change biology_, _23_(1), pp.362-379.

[[climate-change]] expected to cause: 

- increase frequency and severity of extreme events
- lower water availability in equatorial areas
	- decreased productivity 
	- increased mortality
- species distributions shift poleward and upward with
	- increased productivity,
	- increased reproduction,
	- increased landscape scale population density at the leading range edge

General movement of species ranges is useful but does not sufficiently consider regional persistence and loss. Local extreme events can significantly contribute to loss and local topographic features can help resistance to broader temperature changes
