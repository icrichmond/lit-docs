[[MODIS]] [[drought]] monitoring with [[NDVI]] using [[VCI]] 
[[TRMM]] derived [[SPI]]

[[drought]] classifications based on [[Svoboda_et_al_2002]] (SPI), [[Klisch_et_al_2016]] (VCI)

* Extreme drought: SPI ≤ −2, VCI < 10  
* Severe drought: −2 < SPI ≤ −1.5, 10 ≤ VCI ≤ 20
* Moderate drought: −1.5 < SPI ≤ −1, 20 < VCI < 35  
* No drought: SPI > −1, VCI ≥ 35
