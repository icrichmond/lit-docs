[[CMI]] defined in [[Hogg_1994]] and [[Hogg_1999]], designed for Western Canada, is the difference between [[precipitation]] and potential [[evapotranspiration]]. In this region, CMI > 0 indicates a moist climate capable of supporting closed forests and CMI < 0 indicates a drier climate where forests are patchy (parkland) or absent (prairies)

The authors introduce [[SMI]], the soil moisture index, for Western Canada and show that aspen growth responds to soil moisture and not precipitation.
