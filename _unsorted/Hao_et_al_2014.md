[[drought-index]]

- [[PDSI]]
- [[SPI]]
- [[SSI]]
- [[SRI]]

Meteorological [[drought]] (precipitation deficit) may develop quickly and end abruptly. Agricultural [[drought]] (soil moisture deficit) may have some time lag. 

Authors introduce [[MSDI]] the multivariate standardized [[drought-index]]

[[SPI]] uses the gamma distribution to compute the cumulative probability distribution of precipitation. This is then transformed using the inverse of the standard normal distribution. 

[[Svoboda_et_al_2002]] categories of drought applied to [[SPI]], [[SSI]], and [[MSDI]]:

- D0, abnormally dry, -0.5, -0.7
- D1, moderately dry, -0.8, -1.2
- D2, severely dry, -1.3, -1.5
- D3, extremely dry, -1.6, -1.9
- D4, exceptionally dry, < -2


Authors compared [[SPI]], [[SSI]], [[MSDI]] from 1980-2012 and concluded that combining information from multiple variables (eg. precipitation and soil moisture) would improve [[drought]] monitoring
