Response to [[Slette_et_al_2020]]

Standardized measures of [[drought]]
- reflect deviations from the mean
- are sensitive to the distribution of values in the reference period

They highlight the difference between standardized values (SPEI) and P-PET. P-PET is sometimes referred to as climatic water balance, the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration
