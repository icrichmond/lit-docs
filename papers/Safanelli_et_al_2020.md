TAGEE - terrain analysis in [[earth-engine]]

Calculates methods adapted to the spheroid angular grid, eg. WGS84, for [[DEM]] with geographical coordinates without needing to reproject

(Math is described in Florinsky_2016)

Input:

- [[DEM]]
- bounding box

Output: 

- Slope (m)
- Aspect (degrees)
- Hillshade (degrees)
- Northness (unitless)
- Eastness (unitless)
- Curvatures (m)
	- Horizontal
	- Vertical
	- Mean
	- Max
	- Gaussian
- Shape index (unitless)
