[[drought]] legacy effects: water stress impacts on [[vegetation]] at lagged temporal intervals post [[drought]]

In water limited systems, [[tree-rings]] track variation in water availability

Methods are varied:
- Droughts are often defined using a z-scored or standardized drought index
- Metrics, however, differ in their weighting of different drivers of [[drought]], eg. precipitation or evapotranspiration

Also note that legacy effects can also occur from an accumulation of stressors, eg. an increase in the frequency of acute or chronic [[drought]] conditions
