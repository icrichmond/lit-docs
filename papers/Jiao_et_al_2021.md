[[drought]] has a wide range of damaging effects:

- [[food-security]]
- crop damage
- decrease volume of surface water, eg. rivers and lakes
- increase risk of ecosystem fires
- increase risk of tree mortality
- ...

Types of [[drought]]:

- agricultural
- meteorological
- hydrological
- socioeconomic
- flash drought
- environmental 
- ecological

[[climate-change]] will lead to an increase in the severity and the frequency of [[drought]]

Advantages of a multi-sensor approach

- [[drought]] has complex environmental impacts and can affect many ecosystem components in parallel. A single [[drought-index]] likely won't capture the complexity. Use multisensor approach (with ?multivariate retrievals)
- Sensors balance temporal resolution with spatial resolution. Combining multiple [[remote-sensing]] sensors can help build a high spatial and temporal resolution product
- Each sensor is an independent observation, therefore combining multiple sensors can help increase certainty or highlight uncertainty

## [[remote-sensing]] data

- Precipitation: principal variable for identifying and defining meteorological drought
- Land surface temperature
- Soil moisture
- Groundwater and surface water volume
- Snow
- Evapotranspiration: not directly observable but inferred through combined data and interpretive model. Grid cell size and temporal resolution are coarse. 

## Vegetation response to [[drought]]
Stomatal closure, two contrasting strategies

1. Isohydric, species close stomata to decrease leaf rate potential
2. Anisohydric, species have little/no stomatal control as a response to drought

Isohydric species expected to have a decreased GPP compared to anisohydric

Structural changes eg. decreased leaf area, change in leaf shedding or leaf orientation. Hard to measure reliably, but related to LAI leaf area index

Species composition changes in response to drought

## Flash drought (3.6.)
Flash droughts: short term, severe drought, rapid onset, evolving processes

Indices

- ESI: evaporative stress index
- RCI: rapid change index
- EDDI: evaporative demand drought index
- SESR: standardized evaporative stress ratio
