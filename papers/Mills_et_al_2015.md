## Short term vs long term studies
Longer term has higher value, higher impact
Compared to short term where "if you don't get funding you can simply delay that project and pick it up again later", and "only lead to 1-2 publications"

Longer term studies = decades of building infrastructure

## Proposed rules for data access
1. Authorship or at least acknowledgment 
2. No overlap with current research
3. No subsequent sharing

## Reasons not to archive data publicly
Flawed science since only the PIs fully understand the data

Repeating non-published analyses, eg. insignificant results

Less long term studies because of producer-scrounger

Less collaboration

Funding challenges

Missed training opportunities

## Solutions to data sharing
* Collaborate to share
* Confidential, unpublished data sharing until paper is accepted, then data is destroyed
* 1-5 year embargo
* 10-15 year embargo
