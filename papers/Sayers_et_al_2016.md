[[drought]] is divided into three main types (from the glossary):

- Meterological
	- Meterological drought: A temporary, negative and severe deviation from average precipitation values that persists for a sufficient period of time to significantly reduce blue-water or green-water resources in a river basin or region.
- Blue-water
	- Blue-water: freshwater found on the surface (in lakes and rivers) or in the ground (in aquifers).  
	- Blue-water drought: An unusual and significant deficiency in the water stored in freshwater lakes, rivers, aquifers and wetlands.
- Green-water
	- Green-water: the precipitation on land that does not run off (to rivers or lakes) or recharge groundwater but is stored in, or on top, of the soil or [[vegetation]]. Eventually, this part of precipitation is lost through  evaporation or transpiration.
	- Green-water drought: an unusual and significant deficiency in the water stored in the soil layer (from which plants and crops normally draw their water) and / or in vegetation itself.
