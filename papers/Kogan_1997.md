[[VCI]] based on [[NDVI]] defined in [[Kogan_1995a]]
[[TCI]] based on brightness temperature defined in [[Kogan_1995b]]
In case of drought, NDVI is high and BT is low. 
[[VCI]] and [[TCI]] range from 0-100. 
[[VCI]] and [[TCI]] are combined in the [[VHI]].


[[Drought]] impacts (...)

Difference between annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration = balance of moisture received and potentially able to evaporate. Negative balance indicates that [[vegetation]] is likely to be vulnerable to [[drought]].
