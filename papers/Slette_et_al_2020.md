Of the publications that did not clearly define drought, only 50% were found to measuring local regions in periods that were < -1 SPEI  

Authors' recommendations: 
> we urge ecologists to utilize standardized indices (e.g.,  
PDSI, SPEI) to characterize these droughts whenever possible. In  
addition to reporting average and minimum index values during the  
studied drought, authors should include or reference the threshold  
index values used to distinguish drought from normal conditions  
and to determine drought severity.
