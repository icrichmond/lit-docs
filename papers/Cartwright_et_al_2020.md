## Intro
[[climate-change]] is likely to increase the frequency and intensity of droughts. We need broad scale assessments of [[vegetation]] responses to [[drought]].  Biomes differ in timeline responses to [[drought]]. 

## Methods
Measured drought sensitivity as the percent decrease in greenness under drought vs baseline. [[EVI]] strongly correlates with annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP), therefore can be used as a proxy. 

EVI vs NDVI - NDVI saturates in high biomass areas

EVI imagery used: MODIS MOD13A3 monthly 1-km

Masking: 
- cloud, snow, ice
- insect outbreak
- only include forest and shrub
- fire, percent burned in each pixel > 10%. Sum Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity dataset 1984-2015.

SPEI: 
- standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index
- SPEI 3 = summer
- SPEI 6 = summer + winter + early spring drought
- SPEI 12 = previous year

Drought sensitivity = % decrease greenness vs baseline, during drought


## Results
Caveat: RS measured [[vegetation]] responses to [[drought]] only those which have canopy level responses

Found variation within biome and within ecosystem, and variation was mediated by topography, climate and soil characteristics
