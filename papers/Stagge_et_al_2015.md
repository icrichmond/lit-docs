The [[drought-index]] [[SPI]] and [[SPEI]] uses a probability distribution for evaluating [[drought]] sensitivity

> Choice of an improper probability distribution may impart bias to the index values, exaggerating or minimizing drought severity

The authors recommend the two-parameter gamma distribution for calculating [[SPI]] across all antecedent periods and regions within Europe

The distributions of [[SPI]] (precipitation) and [[SPEI]] (water balance) are often highly skewed
