Monthly aggregated [[Daymet]] -> PET -> SPEI

Using the [[R]] package "SPEI"

Definitions of [[drought]], based on [[SPI]] classification by [[Svoboda_et_al_2002]]:

- > 0.5: wet spell
- -0.5, 0.5: normal
- -1.3, -0.5: moderate
- < -1.3: severe

[[SPEI]] is standardized to the mean of the calibration period for a given site
