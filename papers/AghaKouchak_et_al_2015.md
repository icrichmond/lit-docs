[[drought]] classifications:

- meterorological
- hydrological
- agricultural
- socioeconomic


[[SSI]] defined in [[Hao_et_al_2013]]

Evapotranspiration: remotely sensed estimation methods: 

- principles of water balance (soil moisture)
- principles of surface energy balance ([[LST]])
- [[vegetation]] [[spectral-indices]]
- hybrid approaches

For example

- [[ESI]] Evaporative stress index
- [[EDI]] Evaporative [[drought]] index
- [[CWSI]] Crop water stress index


Snow is a natural reservoir of water resources. Deficits in winter snowpack can lead to summer hydrological and/or agricultural [[drought]]. 

- [[SWE]] snow water equivalent
- SA snow albedo
- SD snow depth
- SCA snow covered area

Optical imagery can be used to determine snow covered area, but microwave and infrared required for depth and snow water equivalent.
