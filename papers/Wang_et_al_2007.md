[[NMDI]]: normalized multi-band drought index
[[spectral-indices]] 

NMDI = R860nm -  (R1640nm - R2130nm) / R860nm +  (R1640nm + R2130nm)

> Similar to the Normalized Difference Water Index ([[NDWI]]), NMDI uses the  860 nm channel as the reference; instead of using a single liquid water absorption channel, however, it uses the difference between two liquid water absorption channels centered at 1640 nm and 2130 nm as the soil and vegetation moisture sensitive band
