Methods: [[Landsat]] based [[drought]] [[VCI]] + [[TCI]] = [[VHI]] -> 5 categories of [[drought]]

Landsat

- March, April, May
- Landsat 4, 5, 7, 8

DN to [[LST]]: 

1. Convert DN to at satellite brightness
2. Calculate [[LST]] in Kelvin using Planck's constant, Boltzmann's constant, velocity of light and emissivity
3. Calculate [[LST]] in Celsius (-273)

Classification of [[drought]] using [[VCI]], [[TCI]], [[VHI]]:

- Baseline/not drought >=40
- Mild <40
- Moderate <30
- Severe <20
- Extreme <10

Exclude areas that are not [[vegetation]]

Figures show spatial differences in [[drought]] as defined by [[TCI]] vs [[VCI]]
