Soil water regulates land-atmosphere interaction. Topography correlates with soil properties and imposes strong controls on soil moisture and groundwater dynamics. 

Areas with convergent flow (eg. concave surfaces and low lying valley floors) are typically zones of high moisture content. As [[elevation]] increases, dryness typically increases. 

Other analytical methods for relating local physical properties to the general landscape

- Topographic Wetness Index ([[TWI]] defined by Beven Kirkby 1979) is a topographic descriptor of soil water conditions

Current methods are still lacking large scale normalization of [[topography]] for soil water conditions. 

[[DEM]] have led to hydrologically relevant descriptors of landscapes 

- catchment area
- flow path
- accumulated contributing area
- [[drainage]] networks

One difficulty with some physically based [[hydrology]] metrics is local parameterization. 

Height above the nearest drainage [[HAND]]. A representation of local [[drainage]] potential. The only required input is [[topography]] data.
