Data should be archived with sufficient clarity and supporting information to actually be useful.

Intellectual debt of data generators should be considered by data users when interacting with the data. Co-authorship is not necessarily required because the data will be cited, but it depends on level of involvement. 

Open data is often re-used for broader scale questions, meta-analyses, or new questions.

The published paper can partially function as [[metadata]] or background.
