[[Sayers_et_al_2016]] three types of [[drought]]

Authors argue that methods solely based on spectral [[vegetation]] indices and/or meterological data are insufficient for characterizing drought. In addition, they recommend considering difference elevation and land cover. For example, high mountain areas have shallow soil and low water retention compared to valleys and foothills. 

Measuring drought severity:

[[NMDI]] is affected by both soil and [[vegetation]] [[drought]]. Lower [[NMDI]] values correspond to higher drought severity in areas with dense vegetation (Leaf Area Index > 2). Assigned the highest weight (45%) in areas with dense vegetation

DI is the Disturbance Index based on the tasselled cap transformation. Quantifies deviations in the ecosystem caused by "destructive impacts or processes", potentially a prolonged drought. Weight = 35%. 

[[MSI]] incorporates NIR and one of SWIR bands. It correlates with soil moisture and detects moisture stress in plants with "tolerance of low leaf water content by cellular adjustment that cannot be detected using NIR/R [[vegetation]] indices". Weight = 20%. 

Combining these three according to their weights into an intermediate object, that is split into high and low elevation areas (above or below 900m). These high and low elevation areas are then split by land cover class (grasslands, shrubs, broad leaf, conifer, mixed).
