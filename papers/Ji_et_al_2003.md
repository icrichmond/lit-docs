Authors assess [[vegetation]] responses to [[drought]]

[[SPI]] is based on precipitation only. [[SPI]] proposed categories are 
- extremely wet (> 2.0)
- very wet (1.5 to 1.99)
- moderately  wet (1.0 to 1.49)
- near normal (-0.99 to 0.99)
- moderately  dry ( -1.49 to 1.0)
- severely dry (-1.99 to 1.5)
- extremely dry (< -2.0)

> Recent research has shown that the SPI has many advantages over the PDSI and other indices in that it is relatively simple, spatially consistent, and temporally flexible, thus allowing observation of water deficits at different scale
