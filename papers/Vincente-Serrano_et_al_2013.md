[[vegetation]] responses to [[drought]] across [[biomes]] using three measures:

- [[vegetation]] [[spectral-indices]] using [[remote-sensing]] imagery
- [[ANPP]] above ground [[primary-productivity]]
- [[tree-rings]]

Authors' results: 
- Arid biomes respond to [[drought]] at short time scales
- Humid biomes respond to [[drought]] at short time scales, but likely using different physiological mechanisms than [[vegetation]] in arid [[biomes]]
- Semi-arid and sub-humid biomes responded to [[drought]] at long time scales due to ability to withstand water deficit but lack of rapid response of vegetation in arid biomes

Results were consistent for all 3 vegetation measures

[[SPEI]] is a site specific [[drought-index]] of deviations from average water balance
