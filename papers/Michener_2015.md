Ecologists are continuing to generate large volumes of data

## Uses of [[open-data]]
* meta-analysis, synthesis
* augmenting existing data
* parameterizing models
* [[reproducibility]]

Outside of research

* inform decision making
* contribute to resource management
* education

In some cases, [[open-data]] is the only data available

## Types of ecological data
From [[Bowser_1994]], ecological data is:

* Planned, eg long term C02 in Hawaii
* Opportunistic, eg. short term goals and discrete funding periods
* Serendipitous, eg. animal harvest data, citizen contributed
 
## History of open ecological data
Combined cultural shift towards open science and technological improvements

UNESCO's [[IODE]] started in 1961. Ecological data is behind, and moving slower. 

Michener reviews large ecological initiatives promoting open data [...]

## "Perceived impediments"
* time and labour value
* misinterpretation, misuse of data, flawed science
* [[Kervin_et_al_2014]] lack of experience and training in data management

## Benefits of sharing data
* increased public trust in science
* [[Hampton_et_al_2013]] sharing data accelerates science
* time and money saved

Meanwhile, there are many hidden costs of closed data. [[Uhlir_et_al_2007]]

## Technological advances
* [[metadata]] with [[EML]]
* [[DOI]]
* [[ORCID]]

## Open work
Open Knowledge and the Open Definition Advisory
Council defines open work
* Open license
* Access at nominal or no cost, ideally downloadable free on internet
* Open [[format]]

## Recommendations
Fully document the data
