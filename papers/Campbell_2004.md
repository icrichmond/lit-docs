### Definitions
"Crippling loss" is where animals wounded by hunters are not harvested and die in the wilderness (= waster)

### Discussion
Many early accounts were likely misunderstood because of 

- language barrier
- short temporal sample of [[hunting]] practices
- observations tainted by deeply held [[hunting]] aesthetic
- ethnic stereotypes
- ethnocentric biases

Many problematic articles, with little or poor evidence, or citing other articles with unreliable information

Kelsall 1968 and Miller 1983: inability to distinguish between nations, relate single, misunderstood events as broader patterns of behaviour

Lawrie 1948: the indigenous hunter had "no abstract ideas like conservation to restrain him..."

MacFarlane 1905: "sheer love of killing"

Harper 1955: gave conflicting descriptions of hunter wastage vs. strategy to reduce wastage and avoid pests being attracted, without acknowledging the self-disagreement 

Western perspective

- hunted prey is solely for the consumption of hunter
- humans are distinct from the supposedly natural world surrounding us

Toxic language comparisons, where indigenous hunters have "desire" and "lack control" whereas Western individuals have "restraint" and "self control"

Different understandings and ideas of waste and what it means to respectfully treat [[caribou]]
