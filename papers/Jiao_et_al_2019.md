Solar induced fluorescence ([[SIF]]) is related to the "functional status of photosynthetic machinery". [[SIF]] is the "the fluorescence emission from plant chlorophyll as 1–2% of the energy absorbed by chlorophyll is re-emitted at longer wavelengths as fluorescence during the light reactions process of photosynthesis"

[[SIF]] can be used to monitor drought impacts on vegetation dynamics using a departure from the multiyear mean

The authors correlated [[SIF]] to 
- [[SPI]] (historical distribution of precipitation)
- [[TCI]] (temperature)
- [[SPEI]] (precipitation and temperature)
- [[PDSI]] (dynamics of water balance)

Note: relationship in situ and satellite based shows a generally stronger correlation in dryer locations than wet locations
