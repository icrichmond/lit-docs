## Flawed science
[[Mills_et_al_2015]] mentions "flawed science if data is shared publicly, because only the PIs sufficiently understand the data" - this is not really relevant to animal movement data because the [[structure-of-movement-data]] is simpler. 

## Repeating non-published analyses, eg. insignificant results
Solutions: 

* Publish a pre-print with your insignificant results
* Communicate with downstream data users
* Allow others to explore the data from new perspectives 
* Pre-registration
