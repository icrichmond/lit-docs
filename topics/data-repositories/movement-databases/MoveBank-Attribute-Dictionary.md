### Taxonomy
Recommendation

```
**animal taxon:** The scientific name of the species on which the tag was deployed, as defined by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS, www.itis.gov). If the species name can not be provided, this should be the lowest level taxonomic rank that can be determined and that is used in the ITIS taxonomy. Additional information can be provided using the term 'taxon detail'  
format: controlled list  
entity described: individual  
same as: individual taxon canonical name

**animal taxon detail:** A more specific name and/or reference for the taxon name provided by 'animal taxon'. This can be used, for example, to specify a subspecies or a taxon not supported by the ITIS.  
example: Calonectris diomedea borealis (Cory, 1881)  
units: none
