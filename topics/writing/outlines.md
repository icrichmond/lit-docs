# Outlines
[[writing]] outlines for papers

Mostly notes from [[Belcher_2019]] 

## General
**It can be really valuable to write a post-draft outline, to help identify if the idea is sufficiently focused, or to review how it is more broadly structured** 

## Macrostructures
- Description
- Sequence
- Causation
- Problem-solution
- Comparison

## Reader knowledge oriented order
Use these for framing an intro or an outline or a full paper. Starting with...

* Familiar. What we assume the readers know -> less familiar
* Easy. Simple -> complex
* Accepted. Uncontested -> contested
* Overview. General -> specific
* Few. eg. start with one example, and describe it in detail, then point to a few examples and discuss some similarity, and finally with many examples.
* Historical. Past -> present 

"Few" is really a interesting idea, where you really go deep into one example, then highlight a series that are similar (or different)

## Uneven U
Within a paragraph or across the paper:

- General statement
- --> More evidence
- ---> Summary and interpretation
- --> Connect to a new idea
- whose endpoint is beyond this paragraph

## Structure signals
* Liberal use of subheadings
* 2-3 sentence synopsis of the rest of the article at the end of the intro
* Summing up sentences, synthesis of arguments or conclusions so far. **Not repetition**
