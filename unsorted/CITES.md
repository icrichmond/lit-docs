> [Appendices I, II and III](https://cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php) to the Convention are lists of species afforded different levels or types of protection from over-exploitation (see [How CITES works](https://cites.org/eng/disc/how.php)
> Appendix I lists species that are the most endangered among CITES-listed animals and plants (see [Article II, paragraph 1](https://cites.org/eng/disc/text.php#II) of the Convention). They are threatened with extinction and CITES prohibits international trade in specimens of these species except when the purpose of the import is not commercial (see [Article III](https://cites.org/eng/disc/text.php#III)), for instance for scientific research. In these exceptional cases, trade may take place provided it is authorized by the granting of both an import permit and an export permit (or re-export certificate). [Article VII](https://cites.org/eng/disc/text.php#VII) of the Convention provides for a number of exemptions to this general prohibition. 
> Appendix II lists species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless trade is closely controlled. It also includes so-called "look-alike species", i.e. species whose specimens in trade look like those of species listed for conservation reasons (see [Article II, paragraph 2](https://cites.org/eng/disc/text.php#II) of the Convention). International trade in specimens of Appendix-II species may be authorized by the granting of an export permit or re-export certificate. No import permit is necessary for these species under CITES (although a permit is needed in some countries that have taken stricter measures than CITES requires). Permits or certificates should only be granted if the relevant authorities are satisfied that certain conditions are met, above all that trade will not be detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild. (See [Article IV](https://cites.org/eng/disc/text.php#IV) of the Convention)
> Appendix III is a list of species included at the request of a Party that already regulates trade in the species and that needs the cooperation of other countries to prevent unsustainable or illegal exploitation (see [Article II, paragraph 3](https://cites.org/eng/disc/text.php#II), of the Convention). International trade in specimens of species listed in this Appendix is allowed only on presentation of the appropriate permits or certificates. (See [Article V](https://cites.org/eng/disc/text.php#V) of the Convention)

>  **Overview of data**
>  This zip file contains all trade records (including all historic data) entered in the CITES Trade Database by 10 June 2021 and extracted at the shipment level on 11 June 2021. This file is 2021.v1. Please note that some historic records present in previous versions (2019.2 and 2020.1) may also have been removed or updated (e.g. as a result of nomenclature changes adopted at CoP, or corrections provided by CITES Parties), so we strongly recommend using the most up to date data provided in Version 2021.1.
>  While the data provided through the search function on the Web Portal of the CITES Trade Database are aggregated, the database contains non-aggregated data. The data provided in this download is on a _per-shipment basis_ i.e. it provides the relevant information about each line item in box 7 to 12 of the CITES permit (in line with Notification No. 2019/072) in a separate row.
>  Each csv data file contains ~500 thousand rows of data, and files are numbered chronologically with the earliest trade records in the files with the lower numbers. Each trade record is given a unique identifier (Id) that will remain unchanged across versions.
>  Given their confidential nature, import, export and re-export CITES permit numbers have also been replaced with unique identifiers. This ensures that no confidential data are made available, whilst still enabling users of the data to identify instances where the same permit number may have been used for multiple shipments. The method for generating these unique identifiers is detailed below.
